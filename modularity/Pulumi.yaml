  Modular Infrastructure as Code Demonstration using Pulumi and Python
  
  This project showcases the advantages of using real programming languages 
  for Infrastructure as Code through advanced Python patterns and reusable modules.
  
  Key Features Demonstrated:
  - Object-Oriented Programming with classes and inheritance
  - Design Patterns (Factory, Manager, Builder, Composition)
  - Type Safety and Data Classes
  - Code Reuse across different environments
  - Modular architecture enabling composition
  - Same codebase for dev/staging/production with different configurations
  
  Modules:
  - base_infrastructure: VPC, subnets, routing
  - security_groups: Reusable security patterns
  - compute: EC2 instances and server factories
  - application: Multi-tier and microservices patterns
