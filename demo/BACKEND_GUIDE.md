## 🚀 **Recommended Approach for Your Team**

### **Phase 1: Start with Pulumi Cloud (Free)**
```bash
# Each team member:
pulumi logout
pulumi login                    # Free for up to 3 users
```

**Why start here:**
- Immediate team collaboration
- Built-in best practices
- Learn Pulumi workflow properly
- Easy to evaluate benefits

### **Phase 2: Evaluate and Decide**
After 30 days of usage:
- **Stay with Pulumi Cloud** if collaboration features are valuable
- **Move to self-managed** if cost/control is priority
- **Hybrid approach** - Pulumi Cloud for dev/staging, self-managed for prod

### **Phase 3: Production Setup**
```bash
# For self-managed production (example with S3):
aws s3 mb s3://yourcompany-pulumi-state
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket yourcompany-pulumi-state --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket yourcompany-pulumi-state --server-side-encryption-configuration '{...}'

# Switch production stacks:
pulumi logout
pulumi login s3://yourcompany-pulumi-state
```

## 💡 **Migration Commands**

### **Export from Local, Import to Cloud:**
```bash
# Export current local stack
pulumi stack export --file mystack.json

# Login to new backend
pulumi logout
pulumi login    # or s3://bucket

# Import stack to new backend  
pulumi stack init mystack
pulumi stack import --file mystack.json
```

### **Team Onboarding:**
```bash
# New team member setup:
pulumi login                    # Login to shared backend
pulumi stack select dev         # Select shared stack
pulumi stack output            # View current state
```

## 🎤 **For Your Presentation**

**Opening:** *"Let's talk about how we manage infrastructure state as a team..."*
