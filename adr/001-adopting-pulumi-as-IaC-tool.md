# ADR FOR PULUMI: PULUMI FOR IaC OVER TERRAFORM

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2025-10-01

* Deciders: 
   - Maxwell Adomako
   - Ebenezer Butias

**Technical Lead**: Maxwell Adomako

**Environments that will be Affected**: prod, staging, dev

## Context
### Problem Statement
The team needs a modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution that can leverage existing programming skills while providing strong type safety, reusability, and multi-cloud capabilities. Current manual infrastructure management is error-prone and doesn't scale with team growth.

### Current State
- Mostly manual infrastructure provisioning through AWS Console
- No version control for infrastructure changes
- Inconsistent environments between dev, staging, and prod
- Limited ability to replicate infrastructure for new projects

### Requirements
- Must support AWS as primary cloud provider
- Enable infrastructure version control and code reviews
- Provide type safety and compile-time error checking
- Allow code reusability through modules/components
- Support multiple environments with same codebase
- Enable CI/CD integration for automated deployments

### Assumptions
- Team has strong Python programming skills
- AWS will remain the primary cloud provider
- Infrastructure complexity will grow over time
- Team will adopt GitOps practices

## Decision
We will adopt Pulumi with Python as our Infrastructure as Code platform.

### Why Approach Selected
Pulumi provides a modern approach to IaC that leverages familiar programming languages while maintaining declarative infrastructure definitions.

### Key Technical Decisions
**Infrastructure & Cloud Decisions**
- Cloud Provider: AWS (primary), with multi-cloud capability for future
- Resource Organization: Modular structure with separate modules for networking, security, and compute
- State Management: Pulumi Cloud for team collaboration and state management
- Networking Strategy: VPC per environment with public/private subnet patterns

**Development & Deployment Decisions**
- Language Choice: Python (leverages existing team expertise)
- Stack Strategy: Per-environment stacks (dev, staging, prod) with shared code
- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions for automated preview and deployment
- Testing Strategy: Unit tests for infrastructure components, integration tests for deployed resources
- Security Approach: AWS IAM roles, Pulumi secrets for sensitive data

**Operational Decisions**
- Monitoring & Alerting: CloudWatch integration with Pulumi resource tagging
- Backup & Recovery: Pulumi Cloud state backup, infrastructure code in Git
- Cost Management: Consistent tagging strategy, stack-level cost tracking

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: [Alternative Name]
- **Description**: HashiCorp's mature IaC tool with HCL language
- **Pros**: Large community, extensive provider ecosystem, mature tooling
- **Cons**: Learning new HCL syntax, limited programming language features, verbose for complex logic
- **Why rejected**: Team prefers leveraging existing Python skills, need better abstraction capabilities

### Option 2: [Alternative Name]
- **Description**: AWS's native Infrastructure as Code framework
- **Pros**: Native AWS integration, supports Python, strong type safety
- **Cons**: AWS-only, less mature than alternatives, complex for simple use cases
- **Why rejected**: Want multi-cloud capability for future flexibility

### Option 3: [Status Quo/Do Nothing]
- **Description**: Continue manual infrastructure provisioning
- **Pros**: No learning curve, immediate control
- **Cons**: Error-prone, not scalable, no version control, inconsistent environments
- **Why rejected**: Does not meet scalability and reliability requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
**Technical Benefits**
- Strong type safety catches errors at compile time
- Code reusability through Python modules and classes
- Familiar programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Rich ecosystem of Python packages available for infrastructure logic

**Business Benefits**
- Faster infrastructure provisioning and updates
- Consistent environments reduce deployment issues
- Lower learning curve leverages existing Python skills
- Better collaboration through code reviews

**Team Benefits**
- Infrastructure as code enables version control and rollbacks
- Modular structure improves maintainability
- Automated testing improves confidence in changes
- GitOps workflow aligns with development practic

### Negative
**Technical Risks**
- Newer technology with smaller community than Terraform
- Python runtime overhead compared to compiled tools
- Potential vendor lock-in to Pulumi platform

**Business Risks**
- Initial migration effort from manual processes
- Team training time for Pulumi-specific concepts
- Dependency on Pulumi Cloud service availability

**Operational Risks**
- New debugging complexity for infrastructure issues
- Need to establish new monitoring and alerting patterns
- Potential for more complex failure modes

### Neutral
- Migration from manual to automated is a one-time effort
- Long-term maintenance benefits offset initial learning investment

## Implementation Notes

### Prerequisites
- Pulumi CLI installation for all team members
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM permissions
- Pulumi Cloud account for state management
- Python 3.8+ environment setup

### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** (Week 1-2)
   - Set up Pulumi Cloud organization
   - Create basic project structure with dev stack
   - Implement simple S3 bucket as proof of concept
   - Success criteria: Team can run `pulumi up` successfully

2. **Phase 2: Core Infrastructure** (Week 3-4)
   - Implement networking module (VPC, subnets, routing)
   - Create security groups module
   - Deploy basic EC2 instances
   - Success criteria: Complete dev environment deployed

3. **Phase 3: Production Rollout** (Week 5-6)
   - Create staging and prod stacks
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add monitoring and alerting
   - Success criteria: All environments managed via Pulumi

### Code Changes Required
- Create modular Python structure in `modules/` directory
- Implement `__main__.py` for each stack
- Configure `Pulumi.yaml` and stack-specific configurations
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

### Migration Strategy
- Start with new resources in Pulumi
- Gradually import existing AWS resources using `pulumi import`
- Maintain manual backup during transition period
- Rollback plan: Maintain manual documentation during migration

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual modules using `pulumi test`
- Integration tests using temporary stacks
- Manual validation of deployed resources
- Acceptance criteria: All resources deploy successfully and pass health checks

### Monitoring & Success Metrics
- Infrastructure deployment time (target: <5 minutes for typical changes)
- Deployment success rate (target: >95%)
- Time to recover from failures (target: <15 minutes)
- Team confidence in infrastructure changes (measured via survey)
